class Wrapper:
    """FeatureExtraction-compliant wrapper

    Parameters
    ----------
    wrappable : Wrappable
        Wrappable object. See "Usage" section for a detailed description.
    **params : Dict
        Keyword parameters passed to the wrapped object when supported.

    Usage
    -----
    If `wrappable` already complies with the `FeatureExtraction` API , it is
    kept unchanged. This includes instances of any `FeatureExtraction` subclass,
    `RawAudio` instances, `Precomputed` instances, and `Pretrained instances.
    In this case, keyword parameters are not used.

    * If `wrappable` is a `Path` to a directory containing precomputed features
      or scores (e.g. the one created by `pyannote-audio [...] apply [...]`), it
      stands for:

      Precomputed(root_dir=wrappable, **params)

    * If `wrappable` is a `Path` to the validation directory created by calling
      `pyannote-audio [...] validate [...]`, it stands for:

      Pretrained(validate_dir=wrappable, **params)

    * If `wrappable` is a `Path` to a checkpoint created by calling
      `pyannote-audio [...] train [...]`, (i.e. with the following structure:
      '{root_dir}/train/{protocol}.train/weights/{epoch}.pt)', it stands for:

      Pretrained(validate_dir='{root_dir}/train/{protocol}.train/validate/fake',
                 epoch=int({epoch}), **params)

    * If `wrappable` is a `Text` containing the name of an existing `torch.hub`
      model, it stands for:

      torch.hub.load('pyannote/pyannote-audio', wrappable, **params)

    * If `wrappable` is a `Text` starting with '@' such as '@key', it stands for:

      lambda current_file: current_file['key']

    In any other situation, it will raise an error.

    Notes
    -----
    It is also possible to provide a `Dict` `wrappable`, in which case it is
    expected to contain a unique key which is the name of a `torch.hub` model
    (or any supported `Path` described above), whose corresponding value is a
    dictionary of custom parameters. For instance,

      Wrapper({'sad': {'step': 0.1}}) is the same as Wrapper('sad', step=0.1)

    This is especially useful in `pyannote-pipeline` configuration files:

        ~~~~~ content of 'config.yml' ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
          pipeline:
             name: pyannote.audio.pipeline.SpeechActivityDetection
             params:
                scores:
                   sad:
                      step: 0.1
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
